# RapidIoC
RapidIoC is a lightweight Inversion of Control/Dependency Injection framework written in C#. It helps improve code quality, simplify code maintenance and extendibility. Additionally, its provides a solid foundation for architecting complex projects. The framework is written with game developers in mind, specifically Unity3D, see [RapidIoC for Unity](https://github.com/cpgames/RapidIoCUnity) (although can easily be used for other applications as well).

While developing RapidIoC, we've tried to accomplish the following:
* **Fast integration and development** (hence name "Rapid"). Given the limited time game programmers have to refactor and clean their code and the need to prototype and iterate fast, RapidIoC provides quick and easy solutions for both prototyping, and development.
* **Easy to learn**. If you are familiar with [StrangeIoC](https://github.com/strangeioc/strangeioc), then this should be a no-brainer, as it inherits core concepts from the former. However, in our opinion RapidIoC improves over StrangeIoC's steep learning curve by reducing amount of setup required, provides better starting platform (see [RapidIoC for Unity](https://github.com/cpgames/RapidIoCUnity)), improves on error/exception output, and removes several unnecessary/rarely used (in our subjective opinion) APIs which made StrangeIoC somewhat confusing to beginners.
* **Lightweight**. RapidIoC does not rely on any 3rd party code, it is only around 600 lines of code.
* **Free and open-source**. Code is well documented, and can be modified to your specific needs.

RapidIoC is inspired by [StrangeIoC](http://strangeioc.github.io/strangeioc/exec.html) (they also have good explanation of IoC concepts).
